# The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
#
# - Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or
# "natural"), without a dealer blackjack;
# - Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
# - Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.

# Rules
# - The players are dealt two cards and add together the value of their cards.
# - Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted as ten points
# - A player and the dealer can count an ace as 1 point or 11 points
# - All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card
# - The playerwins by having a score of 21 or by having the higher score
# that is less than 21
# - Scoring higher than 21 results in a loss
